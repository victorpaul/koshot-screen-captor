This is desktop application for making screenshots of selected area on your monitor with automatic uploading them on the server and copying url to the image into your clipboard.

I used this library https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/blob/2.1/COPYING.md for calling cropping with hotkeys Ctrl+ Alt+Alt (Press Ctrl and double click on Alt)

There is a small server I wrote for this app https://github.com/victorpaul/koshots-server

Also you can build jar files for both apps
